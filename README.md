# Cryptarithmetic Solver (Best-First Search)

This project is a Python-based Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver that uses the Best-First Search algorithm to find valid digit assignments for letter-based arithmetic equations. Each letter is assigned a unique digit (0–9) such that the equation remains mathematically correct. The approach uses a heuristic to efficiently explore the search space and verify correct solutions.
